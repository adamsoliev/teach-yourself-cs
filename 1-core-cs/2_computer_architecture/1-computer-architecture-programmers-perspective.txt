  Information Is Bits + Context
    chars => ASCII => bytes

  Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms
    --- compilation system
    preprocessor - modifies .c file according to directives starting with '#'.
    compiler     - translates .c to .s containing assembly-language.
    assembler    - translates .s to .o containing machine-level instructions.
    linker       - link .o file with other precompiled .o files.
    
  It Pays to Understand How Compilation Systems Work

  Processors Read and Interpret Instructions Stored in Memory
    --- hardware organization of a system
    buses       - transfers fixed-size chunks of bytes known as 'words'.
    I/O devices - connected to I/O bus by either controller or adapter.
    main memory - a collection of dynamic random access memory (DRAM).
    processor   - copies data (pointed by PC) into register file from main memory, 
                  executes those instructions (if arithmetic, using APU) and
                  stores results in register file (a collection of word-sized
                  registers), which sends it to main memory.     

  Caches Matter
    L1, L2 (and L3) - increasingly large and decreasingly fast. Have the same 
    performance characteristics as registers but considerable larger. 
    Implemented with static random access memory (SRAM).

    exploiting cache memories correctly can improve performance by an order of
    magnitude.

  Storage Devices Form a Hierarchy
    L0 (registers) <=> L1 (SRAM) <=> L2 (SRAM) <=> L3 (SRAM) <=> L4 (DRAM) <=>
    L5 (local disks) <=> L6 (distributed file systems, web servers).

    each level serves as a cache for the level below.

  The Operating System Manages the Hardware
    ----------------------------------------
    |         Application programs          |
    ----------------------------------------
    |                 OS                    |
    ----------------------------------------
    | Processor | Main memory | I/O devices |
    ----------------------------------------
    |           |             |             | 
    |           |             ---- Files ---
    |           |                           |
    |           ------- Virtual memory -----
    |                                       |
    |--------------- Processes -------------

    process is the OS's abstraction for running a program. each process has its
    own context (state) and is managed by the OS's kernel. can consist of
    multiple execution units (threads).

    virtual memory
      kernel virtual memory   ↑
      stack                   ↑
      shared libraries        ↑ increasing address index 
      heap                    ↑
      program code and data   ↑

    file - a sequence of bytes (every device is modeled as a file)

  Systems Communicate with Other Systems Using Networks

  Important Themes
    parallelism 
      thread-level concurrency
        multiple programs at the same time - concurrency
        multiple threads per single program - thread-level concurrency 

      instruction-level parallelism
        executing multiple instructions at the same time

      single-instruciton, multiple-data (SIMD) parallelism
        single instruction causing mutliple operations to be performated at the
        same time

    the importance of abstractions in computer systems
      on processor side
        instruction set architecture - one instruction set for all types of
        processor implementations

      on operating system side
        files, virtual memory, processes

2. Representing and Manipulating Information
----------------------------------------------------------
The basic definitions of the encodings, derivation such
properties as the range of representable numbers, their bit-level
representations, and the properties of the arithmetic operations.

  The three most important representations of numbers. 
    Unsigned (0 and up)
      addition
      multiplication

    Two's-complement (most common way to represent signed ints (- & +))
      addition
      multiplication
      negation

    Floating point (real numbers)
      additing
      multiplication

  Information Storage
    binary (machine) - hexadecimal (easy to communicate) - decimal (humans)

    word size (w-bit) => virtual address space (0 - ([2^w] - 1)); for example,
    32-bit word size limits the vas to 4GB, while 64-bit leads to a vas of 16
    exabytes. 
      -------------------------------------------------
          C declaration                     Bytes
      ------------------------------    ---------------
      Signed          Unsigned          32-bit  64-bit
      -------------------------------------------------
      [signed] char   unsigned char       1       1
      short           unsigned short      2       2
      int             unsigned            4       4
      long            unsigned long       4       8
      int32_t         uint32_t            4       4
      int64_t         uint64_t            8       8
      char*                               4       8
      float                               4       4
      double                              8       8
      -------------------------------------------------
      * Using fixed-size integer types (int32_t & int64_t) is the best way for
      programmers to have close control over data representations across
      different machines and compilers.
