/*

- First-come, first-served (FCFS), which schedules tasks in the order in which
they request the CPU.

- Shortest-job-first (SJF), which schedules tasks in order of the length of the
tasksâ€™ next CPU burst.

- Priority scheduling, which schedules tasks based on priority.

- Round-robin (RR) scheduling, where each task is run for a time quantum
(or for the remainder of its CPU burst).

- Priority with round-robin, which schedules tasks in order of priority and
uses round-robin scheduling for tasks with equal priority.

Priorities range from 1 to 10, where a higher numeric value indicates a higher
relative priority. For round-robin scheduling, the length of a time quantum is
10 milliseconds.
